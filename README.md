# Food Portal
Three websites about food. **Areund the World** is half-blog half-resource as I try to eat food and listen to music from everywhere in the world. **Spiceapedia** is intended to be a single resource for spices and herbs containing information on what to use them with, how to use them, and other useful information. **AltFood Reviews** is a review site for my reviews of vegan and vegetarian substitutes for non-vegan and non-vegetarian foods.

## Building
It's just a bunch of HTML pages bro. However, it does rely on a few JavaScript and CSS files not included:
* [jQuery v3.3.1](https://jquery.com/download/) JavaScript file.
* [jVectorMap v2.0.3](http://jvectormap.com/download/) JavaScript file and the [World Miller Map](http://jvectormap.com/maps/world/world/) file.
* [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) JavaScript file.
* [Bootstrap, Bootstrap Grid, and Bootstrap Reboot v4.1.1](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS files, and some of the CSS from the [dashboard example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/dashboard/).

## want to make changes?
Go for it! I'll probably accept any code improvements or additions/corrections to Spiceapedia's data. I probably won't accept changes to the reviews and psuedo-blog posts because the only person who can speak for me is me. And my lawyer Jeff.
